A Flutter design-system and widget library for Finance, Wallet, and Banking products. The recommended path is **Theme V3 + Widget V3 + MCP V3 tools + Skills V3**, built from Figma/DTCG tokens with Light/Dark parity and distributed to AI agents through the existing hosted MCP service using Skills V3.

V3 is additive. The legacy theme, widgets, MCP contracts, and skills remain available for backward compatibility, but new development should use V3 paths, semantic tokens, V3-prefixed APIs, and Skills V3.

## V3 at a glance

The V3 stack is designed to move from Figma tokens to reusable Flutter components and agent-assisted delivery without duplicating design decisions:

- **Theme V3** — Figma/DTCG primitive and semantic tokens, deterministic Dart generation, Light/Dark parity, typography, spacing, radius, and shadows.
- **Widget V3** — isolated reusable widgets under `lib/widgets/v3/**` using `V3ThemeScope` and semantic tokens only.
- **MCP V3** — V3-prefixed tools for discovering the foundation, tokens, widgets, source, previews, metadata, patterns, and audit results.
- **Skills V3** — nine workflow skills for Codex, Claude Code, and Kiro covering onboarding, bootstrap, search, install, adapt, preview, Figma-to-code, audit, and upgrade.
- **Remote distribution** — one existing Render endpoint with Bearer authentication; no second V3 service or token set.

Current V3 pilot widget:

- `V3MiniButton` — Primary, Outline, and Ghost variants; Default, Active, Disabled, and Error states; icon slots; Light/Dark preview; tests and metadata.

## Quick start for repository contributors

### Requirements

- Dart SDK compatible with `^3.7.2`
- Flutter SDK compatible with the project Dart constraint
- Node.js `18+` for MCP and documentation tooling

### Install and run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Build and serve the Widget V3 local web preview host (one command, prints the exact URL once ready):

```bash
./scripts/serve-v3-preview.sh
# V3 preview ready: http://127.0.0.1:8090/#/button/V3MiniButton
```

Run any standalone widget preview directly:

```bash
flutter run \
  -t lib/widgets/v3/button/preview_v3_mini_button.dart \
  -d web-server \
  --web-hostname 127.0.0.1 \
  --web-port 8090
```

Run the MCP server locally over stdio:

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm ci
npm start
```

## Theme V3

Theme V3 source files live under `lib/config/themes/v3/`.

### Source-of-truth rules

- Editable token inputs: `lib/config/themes/v3/tokens/**`
- Generated Dart output: `lib/config/themes/v3/generated/**`
- Generator: `lib/config/themes/v3/v3_theme_generator.dart`
- Runtime selector: `V3ThemeScope`
- Detailed guideline: `lib/config/themes/v3/V3_THEME_GUIDELINE.mdx`

Never edit generated V3 files manually. Change token inputs first, then regenerate:

```bash
dart run lib/config/themes/v3/v3_theme_generator.dart
```

### Understanding raw values, primitive tokens, and semantic tokens

The short mental model is:

```text
raw value → primitive token → semantic token → Widget V3
```

This is close to saying “raw value = hardcode, primitive = a named raw value, semantic = a semantically named primitive,” but there is an important distinction: a raw value is not automatically a problem. Raw values must exist somewhere as the source data of the token system. They become harmful hardcoding when application or widget code embeds them directly and bypasses the token layers.

| Layer | Question it answers | Example | Rule in Theme V3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Raw value** | “What is the literal value?” | `#0F172A`, `16`, `8px` | Valid inside editable token sources; do not repeat directly in Widget V3 code |
| **Primitive token** | “Which stable value in the design scale is this?” | `Core/Slate/900`, `Space/16`, `Radius/8` | Gives raw values consistent names and organizes them into reusable scales; it does not describe UI intent |
| **Semantic token** | “What job does this value perform?” | `Content/Primary`, `Background/Primary`, `Border/Focus` | Aliases a primitive by purpose and is the preferred API for widgets; the same semantic path may resolve to different primitives in Light and Dark modes |
| **Widget usage** | “Where is that design role consumed?” | `colors.contentPrimary` | Widget V3 reads semantic APIs through `V3ThemeScope`, never raw values or legacy theme access |

For example, `Core/Slate/900` tells us which color exists in the palette, but not where it should be used. `Content/Primary` tells us that the color is intended for primary foreground content. In Light mode it can alias `Core/Slate/900`; in Dark mode the same `Content/Primary` role can alias `Core/White`. The widget keeps using `colors.contentPrimary` in both modes and does not need theme-specific conditions.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R1["Raw value<br/>#0F172A"] --> P1["Primitive token<br/>Core/Slate/900"]
    R2["Raw value<br/>#FFFFFF"] --> P2["Primitive token<br/>Core/White"]

    P1 -->|"Light alias"| S["Semantic token<br/>Content/Primary"]
    P2 -->|"Dark alias"| S

    S --> G["Generated V3ColorPalette"]
    G --> T["V3ThemeScope.colorsOf(context)"]
    T --> W["Widget V3<br/>colors.contentPrimary"]
```

The complete Theme V3 data flow also includes validation and code generation:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Figma / DTCG raw values"] --> B["Primitive token JSON"]
    B --> C["Semantic Light and Dark aliases"]
    C --> D["Parser and resolver"]
    D --> E["Generated Dart primitives and palettes"]
    E --> F["V3ThemeScope"]
    F --> G["Widget V3"]

    D -. validates .-> H["Alias targets"]
    D -. validates .-> I["Alias cycles"]
    D -. validates .-> J["Light / Dark path parity"]
```

Why this layering matters:

- **Consistency** — changing one primitive updates every semantic role that intentionally references it.
- **Theme switching** — Light and Dark keep the same semantic API while resolving to different primitive values.
- **Design intent** — `contentPrimary` communicates purpose more clearly than `slate900` or `#0F172A`.
- **Safer refactoring** — widgets remain stable when the palette changes because they depend on roles, not literal colors.
- **Design-to-code traceability** — Figma/DTCG aliases, generated Dart output, and Flutter runtime usage can be validated as one chain.

Use this decision rule when writing Widget V3 code:

1. Look for an existing semantic token that matches the UI role.
2. If no semantic role exists, report the design-system gap instead of choosing a visually similar primitive or raw value.
3. Update the editable token source and regenerate when the design system intentionally introduces a new role.
4. Use a primitive directly only when the V3 design specification explicitly requires primitive access; this is an exception, not the default widget API.

### Semantic-first usage

Widget V3 code must use semantic tokens from `V3ThemeScope.colorsOf(context)` and V3 dimension/typography APIs. Do not import the legacy `theme_color.dart`, call `ThemeColors.get()`, or introduce raw design colors inside V3 widgets.

```dart
final colors = V3ThemeScope.colorsOf(context);

return Container(
  color: colors.backgroundPrimary,
  child: Text(
    'Title',
    style: TextStyle(color: colors.contentPrimary),
  ),
);
```

`V3ThemeScope` resolves the generated Light or Dark palette from `Theme.of(context).brightness` without changing the legacy `ThemeData` bootstrap.

## Widget V3

New widgets belong under:

```text
lib/widgets/v3/<category>/
├── v3_<widget>.dart
├── preview_v3_<widget>.dart
└── V3_<WIDGET>_GUIDE.md

test/widgets/v3/<category>/
└── v3_<widget>_test.dart
```

Every Widget V3 should provide:

- A `V3`-prefixed public class and explicit constructor API
- Semantic Theme V3 colors and dimensions
- Light/Dark-compatible behavior
- A standalone preview
- Targeted widget tests
- Accessibility-aware semantics, readable typography, and adequate interaction targets
- A local guide containing `V3 Metadata` and semantic-token dependencies

Read these before creating or changing a Widget V3:

- `lib/widgets/v3/V3_WIDGETS_CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/v3/V3_WIDGET_CONVENTIONS.md`
- `lib/config/themes/v3/V3_THEME_GUIDELINE.mdx`

## V3 Lucide Icon

`V3LucideIcon` is the Theme V3 adapter for using [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons without coupling every reusable component directly to the icon package. Components such as `V3Navigation` and `V3MiniButton` keep their icon properties typed as `Widget`/`Widget?`; callers provide a `V3LucideIcon` or any other suitable widget.

### The simple mental model

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Choose a Lucide name<br/>house, search, credit-card"] --> B["Use the base Dart constant<br/>LucideIcons.house"]
    B --> C["Wrap with V3LucideIcon"]
    C --> D{"svgAsset provided?"}
    D -->|"No — default"| E["Render from lucide_icons_flutter"]
    D -->|"Yes — verified exception"| F["Render the checked-in SVG with flutter_svg"]
    E --> G["Inherit size and semantic color from IconTheme"]
    F --> G
    G --> H["Pass into a Widget-typed component slot"]
```

The two rendering paths mean:

- **Package renderer (default)** — call an icon from `lucide_icons_flutter`; no SVG file needs to be stored in the project.
- **SVG override (exception)** — render a specific SVG file checked into the project when the package output has a verified mismatch with Figma, such as an exact path or stroke requirement.

```dart
// Default: render the icon from lucide_icons_flutter.
const V3LucideIcon(
  LucideIcons.house,
  size: V3IconSize.medium,
  stroke: V3IconStroke.regular,
)

// Exception: use a checked-in SVG instead of the package glyph.
const V3LucideIcon(
  LucideIcons.scanLine,
  size: V3IconSize.large,
  svgAsset: 'lib/assets/icons/v3/lucide/scan-line.svg',
)
```

### Size and stroke roles

| Size role | Value | Typical use |
|---|---:|---|
| `V3IconSize.tiny` | 12px | Mini Button |
| `V3IconSize.small` | 16px | Compact controls |
| `V3IconSize.medium` | 24px | Standard and Navigation icons |
| `V3IconSize.large` | 32px | Primary actions such as Scan |

| Stroke role | Intent | Package family |
|---|---:|---|
| `V3IconStroke.thin` | ~1px | `Lucide100` |
| `V3IconStroke.light` | ~1.5px | `Lucide300` |
| `V3IconStroke.regular` | 2px | `Lucide` |
| `V3IconStroke.bold` | ~2.5px | `Lucide600` |

Color is intentionally not a `V3LucideIcon` constructor property. It flows from the nearest `IconTheme`, allowing a parent Widget V3 to apply semantic Light/Dark, selected, disabled, or error colors without hardcoding them in the icon.

Use an SVG override only after comparing the package renderer with the verified Figma source. Do not copy the complete Lucide SVG library into the repository. Each override must have a pinned upstream source/version, license record, and documented reason.

## Remote MCP V3

Hosted endpoint:

```text
https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
```

The endpoint uses Streamable HTTP and exposes legacy read-only tools plus V3 read-only tools. New integrations should call V3-prefixed tools only.

Key remote V3 tools:

- Foundation: `get_v3_design_system_info`, `get_v3_theme_foundation`
- Tokens: `list_v3_color_tokens`, `search_v3_color_tokens`, `get_v3_color_token`
- Widgets: `list_v3_categories`, `list_v3_widgets`, `search_v3_widgets`
- Source and metadata: `get_v3_widget_details`, `get_v3_widget_metadata`, `get_v3_widget_code`, `get_v3_widget_preview`
- Quality: `audit_v3_widget`
- Authoring guidance: `get_v3_flutter_widget_template`, `get_v3_codebase_patterns`, `get_v3_figma_to_flutter_mapping`

Remote MCP is intentionally read-only. Generation helpers remain local/stdio-only optimizations; agents author and write files locally in the target project after reading remote templates, tokens, metadata, source, and previews.

Public health and capability metadata:

```text
https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/health
https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/info
```

## Configure Remote MCP

The same endpoint and Bearer token provide access to legacy and V3 tools. There is no separate V3 URL or authentication scheme.

> **Bearer token access:** The Bearer token is private and is never published in this repository. Request it directly from **Niwat, the repository owner, only**. Never accept it from another source or share it in commits, chat messages, screenshots, documentation, or config examples.

### Codex

Set the private Bearer token in your environment:

```bash
export MCP_BEARER_TOKEN="<TOKEN_FROM_NIWAT>"
```

Configure the MCP server in Codex with the following URL and header:

```text
URL: https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
Header: "Authorization: Bearer ${MCP_BEARER_TOKEN}"
```

### Claude Code

```bash
export MCP_BEARER_TOKEN="<TOKEN_FROM_NIWAT>"

claude mcp add --transport http flutter-widget-wallet-mcp \
  https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${MCP_BEARER_TOKEN}"
```

### Kiro and generic MCP clients

Use the generic Streamable HTTP configuration shape supported by the client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flutter-widget-wallet-mcp": {
      "url": "https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN_FROM_NIWAT>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Prefer environment-backed headers when the client supports them. The repository reference is `mcp-server/examples/remote.generic.mcp.json`.

## Gemini Spark: one-time OAuth setup

Gemini Spark cannot attach the private static `Authorization: Bearer ...` header used by Codex, Claude Code, Kiro, and generic clients. It connects through the additive OAuth Resource Gateway instead:

```text
Gemini Spark
    → Auth0 Authorization Code + PKCE S256
    → https://flutter-widget-wallet-oauth-gateway.onrender.com/mcp
    → dedicated gateway-only bearer
    → https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
```

The original MCP endpoint and existing client configurations do not change. The following recipe is the exact Personal/Staging configuration verified end-to-end on `2026-08-05`: Gemini authenticated through Auth0, synchronized all `28` deployed read-only tools, and successfully called representative Widget V3 tools.

> **Scope:** this is a single-owner Personal/Staging setup on Render Free using Auth0 Google development keys. It is not a production SLO. Render Free can cold-start after being idle, and a future production rollout must use project-owned Google OAuth credentials and reopen the production gates in `docs/v3/V3_GEMINI_SPARK_OAUTH_GATEWAY_PLAN.md`.

### Fast path: connect to the existing deployed Gateway

Use this path when the repository owner has already provisioned the existing MCP, Gateway, Auth0 API, and Auth0 Application.

#### Values required

Obtain these values from the repository owner or the named secret stores. Do not paste them into Git, issues, PRs, screenshots, documentation, or ordinary chat:

| Value | Source | Secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway URL | Render Gateway service | No |
| Auth0 Client ID | Auth0 → Applications → Gemini Spark MCP Staging | No |
| Auth0 Client Secret | Same Auth0 Application → Settings | **Yes** |

Current verified Gateway URL:

```text
https://flutter-widget-wallet-oauth-gateway.onrender.com/mcp
```

Do not enter the original direct-bearer URL (`https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`) in Gemini. That URL remains for existing Bearer clients.

#### Connect once in Gemini Spark

1. Open Gemini Spark → **แอปที่เชื่อมต่อ** (Connected Apps).
2. Under **แอปที่กำหนดเองสำหรับ Spark**, choose **เพิ่มแอปที่กำหนดเอง**.
3. Enter the Gateway URL exactly:

   ```text
   https://flutter-widget-wallet-oauth-gateway.onrender.com/mcp
   ```

4. Expand **การตั้งค่าขั้นสูง** (Advanced settings).
5. Enter the Auth0 **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the existing `Gemini Spark MCP Staging` Regular Web Application.
6. Use **คัดลอก URL การเปลี่ยนเส้นทาง** to copy the callback generated by Gemini. It must be the callback for the **Gateway hostname**, not an older callback generated from the original MCP hostname.
7. Before continuing, open Auth0 → Applications → `Gemini Spark MCP Staging` → Settings. Add that callback under **Allowed Callback URLs** as an exact match, then save.
8. Return to Gemini, choose **ถัดไป**, accept the custom-MCP trust disclosure, and connect the Google/Auth0 account.
9. On the final **บันทึกแอปที่กำหนดเอง** screen, set **ชื่อแอป** to:

   ```text
   flutter-widget-wallet-mcp
   ```

10. Confirm that Gemini shows **28 available actions** for the currently deployed catalog, then choose **เชื่อมต่อ**.

Expected result:

```text
Name:    flutter-widget-wallet-mcp
Handle:  @flutter-widget-wallet-mcp
Status:  connected and enabled
Tools:   28 for the verified deployment (do not hardcode this count in Gateway code)
```

The tool count may increase when the upstream catalog is intentionally deployed. The authoritative check is that Gemini's list matches `tools/list` from the current upstream deployment, not that it always equals `28`.

### Full setup: provision Auth0, Render, and Gemini from scratch

Complete the steps in this order. Changing the order is the most common cause of callback, identity-allowlist, or upstream-authentication failures.

Prerequisites: repository access, Render access to both services, Auth0 tenant admin access, Gemini Spark custom-app access, and Node.js `22+` for the `oauth-gateway` package. “One-time” means the connection remains reusable until a credential, callback, allowlist, service URL, or Google account link is changed or revoked.

#### 1. Preserve the existing MCP and create a Gateway-only bearer

Generate a new cryptographically random bearer outside Git and terminal logs. In the existing Render MCP service:

1. Append it to `MCP_REMOTE_BEARER_TOKENS`.
2. Preserve every existing user bearer; never replace the list with only the Gateway value.
3. Verify both an existing user bearer and the new Gateway bearer against the deployed read-only tools.
4. Store the new value as `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_BEARER` only in the Gateway Render service.
5. Never give the Gateway `MCP_REMOTE_PROXY_SHARED_SECRET`.

Follow the rotation and emergency-revoke sequence in `docs/v3/V3_GEMINI_SPARK_GATEWAY_CREDENTIAL_RUNBOOK.md`.

#### 2. Create the Auth0 API

In Auth0 → **Applications → APIs**, create an API with:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `Flutter Widget Wallet MCP Gateway` |
| Identifier / Audience | exact public Gateway `/mcp` URL |
| Signing algorithm | `RS256` |
| Permission | `mcp:read` |

For the verified service, the audience is:

```text
https://flutter-widget-wallet-oauth-gateway.onrender.com/mcp
```

The audience must exactly match `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` in Render and the `resource` published by the Gateway's Protected Resource Metadata.

#### 3. Create the Auth0 Application

Create an Auth0 Application with:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `Gemini Spark MCP Staging` |
| Application type | Regular Web Application |
| Application ownership | Third-party |
| Grant | Authorization Code |
| Token signing | RS256 via the Auth0 API |
| API permission | `mcp:read` |
| Dynamic Client Registration | Disabled; use static Client ID/Secret |
| Refresh token | Not required for the verified staging flow |

Then configure all of the following before the final Gemini connection:

1. Under **API Access**, authorize this Application for the Gateway API and `mcp:read`.
2. Under **Connections**, enable the Google social connection for this Application.
3. Under **Authentication → Social → Google**, ensure the connection is enabled at the tenant/domain level. A third-party Application can fail login even when its local toggle looks correct if the domain-level connection is unavailable.
4. Under **User Management → Users**, obtain the exact Auth0 `sub` for the single owner. Put that exact subject in `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS`; do not leave a placeholder.
5. Use the Application's Client ID for `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IDS`.

Auth0 development keys are acceptable only for this Personal/Staging flow. For production, configure project-owned Google Client ID/Secret instead.

#### 4. Deploy the OAuth Gateway on Render

Create a **separate** Render Web Service. Do not rename or replace the existing `flutter-widget-wallet-mcp` service.

| Render setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Root directory | `oauth-gateway` |
| Runtime | Node |
| Region | Singapore |
| Instance | Free for Personal/Staging |
| Build command | `npm ci` |
| Start command | `npm start` |
| Health check path | `/health` |
| Instance count | Exactly 1 |
| Edge caching | Disabled |

Set these environment variables in the Gateway Render service:

```dotenv
GATEWAY_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://YOUR-GATEWAY.onrender.com
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT.auth0.com/
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://YOUR-GATEWAY.onrender.com/mcp
GATEWAY_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS=AUTH0_SUB_OF_THE_SINGLE_OWNER
GATEWAY_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IDS=AUTH0_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID
GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_BEARER=GATEWAY_ONLY_SECRET
GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_URL=https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
GATEWAY_REQUIRED_SCOPE=mcp:read
GATEWAY_TRUST_PROXY=true
```

Keep the limits from `oauth-gateway/.env.example` unless a verified requirement says otherwise. Leave `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` empty because Gemini is a server-side OAuth/MCP client. Do not set `GATEWAY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL` on Render.

After deploy, verify the public non-secret endpoints:

```bash
curl -fsS https://YOUR-GATEWAY.onrender.com/health
curl -fsS https://YOUR-GATEWAY.onrender.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
curl -i -X POST https://YOUR-GATEWAY.onrender.com/mcp
```

Required results:

- `/health` returns a healthy response.
- Protected Resource Metadata returns the exact Gateway `/mcp` resource, Auth0 issuer, and `mcp:read`.
- Unauthenticated `/mcp` returns `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` and a `resource_metadata` URL.

#### 5. Register the exact Gemini callback

Start adding the custom app in Gemini using the deployed Gateway URL and expand Advanced settings. Copy the redirect URL shown by Gemini, then add it to the Auth0 Application's **Allowed Callback URLs** exactly.

For the verified Gateway, Gemini generated a callback whose suffix uses:

```text
flutter-widget-wallet-oauth-gateway_onrender_com
```

Do not reuse a callback ending in `flutter-widget-wallet-mcp_onrender_com`; that belongs to a different hostname and Auth0 will reject it.

#### 6. Connect, name, and verify in Gemini

Follow the Fast Path steps above. On the final save screen, set the name to `flutter-widget-wallet-mcp`. Verify all of these signals before declaring success:

- Card name and handle are `flutter-widget-wallet-mcp` / `@flutter-widget-wallet-mcp`.
- Status is **เชื่อมต่อแล้ว** and the app switch is enabled.
- The available action list matches the current upstream `tools/list` (verified deployment: `28`).
- Representative calls succeed: `list_v3_categories`, `list_v3_widgets`, and `search_v3_widgets`.
- Render Gateway logs show authenticated `200`/`202` requests without token, code, cookie, secret, subject, or request-body leakage.
- The original MCP `/health` remains healthy and existing Bearer clients require no config change.

### Renaming an existing Gemini custom MCP app

Gemini Spark currently does not expose an edit-name action after the custom app is saved. To rename without changing MCP behavior:

1. Record the Gateway URL and confirm the Auth0 Client ID/Secret are available in Auth0.
2. Open the existing app's details and choose **นำแอปออก**.
3. Recreate it with the same Gateway URL and the same Auth0 Application credentials.
4. Repeat the account-linking consent.
5. Set the new name on the final save screen, then verify the tool count and representative calls again.

Removing the Gemini connection does not delete external MCP, Render, Auth0, repository, or widget data. It does remove the stored Gemini connection and credentials, so do not remove it until the Auth0 Client Secret is available for re-entry.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth0 callback mismatch | Callback was copied for another hostname or differs by one character | Copy the redirect URI from the current Gemini form and add it to Auth0 as an exact match |
| Google login is unavailable | Third-party Application does not have the Google connection at both Application and tenant/domain levels | Enable Google under the Application's Connections and Auth0 Authentication → Social |
| Gateway returns `invalid_subject` | `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS` is a placeholder or the wrong Auth0 user | Copy the exact owner `sub` from Auth0 Users/logs, update Render, and redeploy |
| Gateway returns invalid client | Wrong Auth0 Application Client ID is allowlisted | Set `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IDS` to the static Gemini Auth0 Application Client ID |
| Gateway returns wrong audience/scope | Auth0 API Identifier, Render audience, or permission differs | Make the API Identifier, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`, Gateway `/mcp` resource, and `mcp:read` permission identical |
| Login succeeds but connection is stale | Google retains an older custom-app account link | Remove only this custom connection from Google Account Connected Apps, then connect again |
| First request is slow or times out | Render Free service cold-started after idle | Wait for `/health` to become healthy, then reconnect or retry; use a paid instance only when a production SLO is required |
| Gemini displays no tools | Upstream bearer is missing/invalid, upstream is unhealthy, or OAuth claims were rejected | Check Gateway structured logs, upstream `/health`, bearer overlap, issuer/audience/scope/subject/client allowlists |
| Initialize works inconsistently with SSE | Gateway code is older than the SSE InitializeResult fix | Deploy a commit containing the SSE `data` event validation and run `cd oauth-gateway && npm test` |
| Name is wrong after saving | Gemini does not provide post-save rename | Remove and recreate the Gemini connection; set the name on the final save screen |

### Security rules

- Never commit or print Auth0 Client Secret, access token, authorization code, refresh token, Gateway bearer, existing user bearers, cookies, or full OAuth/MCP request bodies.
- Store Auth0 Client Secret only in Auth0 and Gemini's credential UI.
- Store `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_BEARER` only in the two Render secret stores that need it: the Gateway and the existing MCP bearer list.
- Keep user bearer tokens out of the Gateway.
- Keep `MCP_REMOTE_PROXY_SHARED_SECRET` out of the Gateway, Gemini, and Auth0.
- Use exact subject/client/callback allowlists and one Gateway instance until session state is externalized or affinity is proven.

## Install Skills V3

Skills V3 turn the Design System V3 catalog into guided, repeatable delivery workflows for AI coding agents. Instead of copying an isolated Dart snippet, an agent can inspect the target workspace, find the closest V3 component, retrieve its source and semantic-token requirements through MCP, install it with previews and tests, adapt it to the host project, and verify the result without falling back to the legacy theme.

Use Skills V3 for both ends of the adoption journey:

- **Learn the system before changing code** — use the read-only onboarding skill to understand Theme V3, design tokens, Widget V3, Lucide icons, previews, Remote MCP, and which implementation skill should run next.
- **Start a new Flutter project** — bootstrap a new app, install the Theme V3 runtime foundation, add a starter Widget V3, wire Light/Dark themes, create a standalone preview and tests, then run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.
- **Adopt V3 in an existing Flutter project** — scan the existing architecture, preserve the current app and legacy widgets, install selected components under `lib/widgets/v3/**`, adapt them to the project's own `V3ThemeScope`, and integrate them into the UI through an explicitly confirmed change scope.
- **Work from a selected UI element** — when an IDE, Flutter Inspector, Dart tooling, or agent host can provide the selected widget's class, source file, line, or widget-tree context, use that selection as the exact integration target. The agent can identify the intended role of the selected element, search for a matching Widget V3, show a live preview, install and adapt it, then replace or compose it at that location after confirmation.
- **Move from Figma to working Flutter UI** — map design intent to existing Widget V3 components first, then create a new semantic-token-based component only when the catalog has no suitable match.
- **Maintain imported components** — audit Theme V3 compliance, detect raw colors or legacy theme leakage, compare local code with the latest MCP source, and selectively upgrade without discarding intentional product-specific customization.

### Install the native skill pack

Connect Remote MCP first, then copy the native Skills V3 pack into the target project.

### What each Skill V3 does

| Skill | Use it when | What it can do |
|---|---|---|
| `flutter-widget-v3-onboard` | You are new to the system or need to choose the correct V3 workflow | Explains the complete V3 architecture in the user's language, performs an optional read-only workspace orientation, links the relevant Wiki/source, and recommends the smallest next skill without changing files |
| `flutter-widget-v3-beginner` | You are starting a new Flutter app or reusable UI package, or an existing app has not adopted the MCP foundation yet | Classifies the workspace, supports app or package-ui-library output, adapts source Theme/Widget V3 into generic or brand-owned consumer names, adds a starter widget, preview and tests, and verifies Light/Dark behavior |
| `flutter-widget-v3-search` | You know the UI intent but not the component name | Searches by category, keyword, behavior or design intent; compares the best candidates, semantic-token dependencies, preview availability and expected adaptation effort |
| `flutter-widget-v3-install` | You have chosen a Widget V3 and want it in the current project | Retrieves metadata, Dart source and preview from MCP; installs the component into V3 paths; rewires it to the target project's `V3ThemeScope`; adds or refreshes its guide and targeted tests |
| `flutter-widget-v3-adapt` | An imported component works but does not yet feel native to the host app | Aligns imports, constructor shape, naming, semantic tokens, preview data and code patterns with the target project's Theme V3 foundation while preserving behavior |
| `flutter-widget-v3-preview` | You want to inspect a component before or after integration | Opens a readiness-checked live browser preview with Light/Dark coverage; outside the source repo it can use the published Flutter Web bundle without installing Flutter or writing into the consumer workspace |
| `flutter-widget-v3-figma-to-code` | You have a Figma component or structured handoff | Checks for reusable V3 components first, maps Figma values to semantic tokens, scaffolds a new V3-prefixed widget only when necessary, and hands the result to preview and validation workflows |
| `flutter-widget-v3-audit` | You want a quality review after installation or adaptation | Detects legacy theme imports, raw `Color(...)` values, missing `V3ThemeScope`, preview, metadata or tests; prioritizes findings and can apply explicitly requested safe fixes |
| `flutter-widget-v3-upgrade` | A locally imported Widget V3 may be behind the current library source | Compares local code, metadata and preview with MCP, separates upstream improvements from local customization and breaking changes, then performs a selective upgrade |

### Use case: create a new Flutter project

Start with `flutter-widget-v3-beginner` in confirmed `bootstrap-new` mode. The skill follows the mandatory `ask → scan → summarize → confirm → execute` flow, collects the output shape, consumer naming, project/package details and target platforms, checks that the destination is safe, runs the app or package template, installs the MCP foundation, adapts source names to the consumer API, adds a starter component with preview and tests, and runs verification.

Example request:

```text
Use flutter-widget-v3-beginner to create a new Flutter app named wallet_demo
for Android, iOS, and Web. Install Theme V3 and add a starter V3 button.
Show me the proposed files and wait for confirmation before making changes.
```

### Use case: import Widget V3 into an existing Flutter UI

For an existing project, combine the skills as a pipeline:

```text
search → preview → install → adapt → audit
```

1. Use `flutter-widget-v3-search` to find the closest component for the intended UI behavior.
2. Use `flutter-widget-v3-preview` to inspect its states and Light/Dark appearance before changing the app.
3. Use `flutter-widget-v3-beginner` first if the project does not yet have Theme V3; otherwise use `flutter-widget-v3-install` to bring in the selected source, preview, guide and tests.
4. Use `flutter-widget-v3-adapt` to align the component with the host project's semantic tokens and conventions.
5. Integrate the component into the requested screen only after confirming the target file and change scope, then use `flutter-widget-v3-audit` to check the completed integration.

Example request:

```text
Scan this existing Flutter project and find a Widget V3 for the primary action
in the checkout footer. Preview the best candidates first. After I confirm one,
install and adapt it to the existing Theme V3, then replace only that action.
Preserve the current business logic and callbacks.
```

### Use case: target an element selected with Flutter Inspector or Dart tooling

Inspector-assisted work makes the integration target more precise. Select the element in Flutter Inspector, DevTools, an IDE widget tree, or another Dart-aware inspection tool, then provide the agent with the available selection context: widget class, source path, line number, parent/child context, current props and the desired behavior.

```text
Selected element: CheckoutFooter > ElevatedButton
Source: lib/features/checkout/presentation/checkout_page.dart
Intent: replace this visual component with the closest Primary Widget V3 button
Constraint: preserve onPressed, loading state, analytics, and surrounding layout
Flow: search → preview → confirm → install → adapt → integrate → audit
```

The inspector supplies context; Skills V3 do not control Flutter Inspector directly. Component source remains under `lib/widgets/v3/**`. Editing an application screen outside V3 paths is a separate integration action and must be explicitly included in the confirmed scope, so selecting an element never silently authorizes unrelated UI changes.

Canonical specification: `docs/v3/V3_SKILLS_SPEC.md`

## Recommended agent workflow

1. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` and `MEMORY.md`.
2. Connect to the existing Remote MCP endpoint.
3. Install the native Skills V3 pack for the agent.
4. Use `flutter-widget-v3-search` before building anything new.
5. Install or author only under V3 theme/widget/test paths.
6. Use semantic tokens through `V3ThemeScope`; never fall back to the legacy theme.
7. Keep standalone previews, Light/Dark coverage, tests, and local metadata guides aligned.
8. Run the narrowest relevant verification, then broader regression gates when required.

The mandatory beginner workflow is:

```text
ask → scan → summarize → confirm → execute
```

No files should be changed before the user confirms the proposed bootstrap scope.

## Localization and previews

Localization source of truth:

```text
lib/l10n/localization.json
```

Generated ARB and localization Dart files must not be edited manually.

```bash
dart run tool/generate_arb.dart
flutter gen-l10n
```

Supported locales:

- English (`en`)
- Thai (`th`)
- Chinese (`zh`)
- Russian (`ru`)
- Myanmar (`my`)

Preview options:

- Widget V3 local web preview host: `./scripts/serve-v3-preview.sh` (builds/serves `lib/preview_v3/main.dart`, prints the exact `http://127.0.0.1:8090/#/<category>/<WidgetClass>` URL once ready)
- Standalone Widget V3 (single widget, direct debug entrypoint): `flutter run -t lib/widgets/v3/<category>/preview_v3_<widget>.dart -d <device>`
- Browser preview: add `-d web-server --web-hostname 127.0.0.1 --web-port <port>`

New Widget V3 previews are discovered from `lib/widgets/v3/**/preview_v3_*.dart`. Run `dart run tool/generate_v3_preview_registry.dart` after adding or renaming one; never hand-edit `lib/preview_v3/preview_registry.g.dart`.

## Verification commands

### Flutter and V3 boundaries

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
npm run check:v3-boundaries
npm run test:v3-boundaries
npm run validate:v3-skills
```

### MCP local and hosted transport

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm ci
npm run check:mcp-syntax
npm test
npm run verify:mcp
npm run verify:mcp:http
```

### Deployed Render endpoint

Remote verification requires a valid private Bearer token:

```bash
cd mcp-server

MCP_REMOTE_BASE_URL="https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp" \
MCP_REMOTE_BEARER_TOKEN="${MCP_BEARER_TOKEN}" \
npm run verify:mcp:remote

MCP_REMOTE_BASE_URL="https://flutter-widget-wallet-mcp.onrender.com/mcp" \
MCP_REMOTE_BEARER_TOKEN="${MCP_BEARER_TOKEN}" \
npm run verify:mcp:remote:v3
```

## Legacy compatibility

V3 does not replace or silently migrate the legacy system:

- Legacy theme files under `lib/config/themes/` remain stable.
- Legacy widgets outside `lib/widgets/v3/` remain supported and are not migrated automatically.
- Legacy MCP tool names, schemas, response fields, and error behavior remain protected by regression tests.
- Legacy skills under `skills/**` remain unchanged; V3 skills live separately under `skills-v3/**`.
- Existing MCP integration files change only additively when registering V3 tools.
- Remote generation/write tools remain excluded.

New implementation work should use V3 unless a task explicitly targets legacy compatibility or maintenance.

Read sources in this order when they disagree:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `MEMORY.md`
3. Live source code and build scripts
4. Widget-local V3 guide/context files
5. Broad overview documentation, including this README
